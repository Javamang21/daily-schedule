## Description 
- This website is a daily planner that allows a user to save tasks from 9 AM - 5 PM.

- Our objective was to set the current time at the top of the screen, and make sure each time slot changed color depending on whether: it is the curent time, the time is coming up, or the time has already passed by.

- We had to include CSS and Javascript frameworks. These included Bootstrap, and JQuery.
